# Predictive Maintenance Machine Learning

This is my capstone project in the [Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) and will serve as a demonstration of end-to-end machine learning.

The problem I want to explore is prediction of machine failure from maintenance data.
From the UCI Machine Learning Repository I have chosen to work with the [AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset).
The exploratory data analysis, feature extraction and modeling will be documented in Jupyter notebooks.
All machine learning training will be done on [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)

The final analysis and insights will be documented in a report.
